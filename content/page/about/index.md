Hello, my name is Tatma, and i am currently studying Computer Science at the Islamic University of Indonesia. I have an interest for programming and technology, especially in backend development. Since studying Computer Science, I have been fascinated with the power of programming and the endless possibilities it offers. I have always enjoyed solving problems and creating innovative solutions through programming

Throughout my academic journey, i have been involved in various programming projects, which have allowed me to gain practical experience . most of the project are assignments from campus which will be exhibited at the end of the semester. Additionally, I am also interested in Competitive Programming, which allows me to sharpen my problem-solving skills and programming abilities.

As i continue my education, I am looking forward to further developing my skills in computer science and exploring new technologies such as cloud computing. My goal is to become a skilled and experienced solution enabler who can contribute to the creation of innovative and impactful solutions with the help of technologies.
